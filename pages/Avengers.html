      The sequel was announced in May 2012 after the successful release of The
      Avengers, with Whedon set to return as writer and director in August.
      Whedon updated Ultron's origin for the film to involve the MCU's Avengers
      team, and introduced the characters Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to whom
      Marvel shared the rights with 20th Century Fox. Casting began in June 2013
      with the re-signing of Downey. Second unit filming began in February 2014
      in South Africa with principal photography taking place between March and
      August, primarily at Shepperton Studios in Surrey, England. Additional
      footage was filmed in Italy, South Korea, Bangladesh, New York state, and
      around England. With an estimated net production budget of $365 million,
      the film is the second most expensive film ever made
