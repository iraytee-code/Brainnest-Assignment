      Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is a 2022 American superhero
      film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Doctor Strange.
      Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion
      Pictures, it is the sequel to Doctor Strange (2016) and the 28th film in
      the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Sam Raimi,
      written by Michael Waldron, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen
      Strange, alongside Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong,
      Xochitl Gomez, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Rachel McAdams. In the film, Strange
      protects America Chavez (Gomez), a teenager capable of traveling the
      multiverse, from Wanda Maximoff (Olsen).

      Doctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson had plans for a
      sequel by October 2016. He signed to return as director in December 2018,
      when Cumberbatch was confirmed to return. The film's title was announced
      in July 2019 along with Olsen's involvement, while Jade Halley Bartlett
      was hired to write the film that October. Derrickson stepped down as
      director in January 2020, citing creative differences. Waldron and Raimi
      joined the following month and started over, adding elements of the horror
      genre that Raimi had worked with previously and making Maximoff the
      villain of the film, continuing her story from the series WandaVision
      (2021). Filming began in November 2020 in London but was put on hold in
      January 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Production resumed by March
      2021 and concluded in mid-April in Somerset. Shooting also occurred in
      Surrey and Los Angeles.
