    <p>
      The US has two interceptor launch sites aimed at intercepting any nuclear
      warhead launches; the first, Fort Greely in Alaska, is attacked by unknown
      assailants presumably affiliated with a terrorist faction, while 16
      nuclear warheads are simultaneously seized from Russian territory. The
      second site is a remote platform in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.
      Captain J. J. Collins is recently reassigned to the latter of the two
      interceptor missile launch sites. Following the conclusion of a high
      profile case where she reported sexual misconduct by one of her superiors,
      she experienced hazing, bullying and threats from her peers in the
      military as revenge, hence her new deployment to this remote station.

      Under the command of Lt. Colonel Marshall, and working alongside Baker and
      Shah in the station's command center, Collins finds herself as part of the
      last line of defense after the hostile takeover of Fort Greely. The
      station is infiltrated by a small group of operatives led by ex-military
      intelligence soldier Kessel, who promptly kill Marshall and the other
      occupants of the base, leaving only Collins, Shah, and an unconscious
      Baker, who was grazed by a stray bullet, as the survivors, holed up in the
      command center. The infiltrators attempt to negotiate entry into the
      command center, by which they can disarm the interceptor system and leave
      the continental US open to nuclear attack from the sixteen stolen
      warheads. They are rebuffed however, and attempt to forcibly enter instead
      with blowtorches. An operative launches a surprise attack after entering
      via a floor hatch, but is defeated and killed by Collins and Shah. Baker
      regains consciousness and reveals himself to be an inside man for the
      infiltrators and motivated by a big pay day, holding both Collins and Shah
      at gunpoint while allowing Kessel and the remaining operatives to enter
      and assume control.
