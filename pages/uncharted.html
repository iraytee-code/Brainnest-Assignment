      Uncharted is a 2022 American action-adventure film directed by Ruben
      Fleischer from a screenplay by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt
      Holloway, based on the video game franchise developed by Naughty Dog and
      published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It stars Tom Holland as
      Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan, with Sophia Ali, Tati
      Gabrielle, and Antonio Banderas in supporting roles. In the film, Drake is
      recruited by Sullivan in a race against corrupt billionaire Santiago
      Moncada (Banderas) and mercenary leader Jo Braddock (Gabrielle) to locate
      the fabled treasure of the Magellan expedition.

      Uncharted entered development in 2008 with producer Avi Arad stating that
      he would be working with Sony Pictures to develop a film adaptation of the
      video game franchise. It entered a complicated production process with
      various directors, screenwriters, and cast members attached at various
      points. Filmmakers David O. Russell, Neil Burger, Seth Gordon, Shawn Levy,
      Dan Trachtenberg, and Travis Knight were initially signed to direct while
      Wahlberg was set to play Drake in early development. Holland was cast as
      Drake in May 2017 and Fleischer was hired as the director in early 2020.
      Principal photography commenced in March 2020, before being quickly
      halted, resuming in July and finishing that October, with filming
      locations including Babelsberg Studio in Berlin and on location across
      Spain and Southeast Asia.
