      Spider-Man: No Way Home is a 2021 American superhero film based on the
      Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, co-produced by Columbia Pictures and
      Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the
      sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home
      (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film
      was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers.
      It stars Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya,
      Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem
      Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew
      Garfield, and Tobey Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange
      (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as Spider-Man a secret
      again following its public revelation at the end of Far From Home. When
      the spell goes wrong, the multiverse is broken open which allows visitors
      from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe.

      A third MCU Spider-Man film was planned during the production of
      Homecoming in 2017. Negotiations between Sony and Marvel Studios to alter
      their deal—in which they produce the Spider-Man films together—ended with
      Marvel Studios leaving the project in August 2019, but a negative fan
      reaction led to a new deal between the companies a month later. Watts,
      McKenna, Sommers, and Holland were set to return, and filming took place
      from October 2020 to March 2021 in New York City and Atlanta. No Way Home
      features several actors reprising their roles from non-MCU Spider-Man
      films directed by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, including previous Spider-Man
      actors Maguire and Garfield. The involvement of both actors was the
      subject of wide speculation and numerous leaks despite the efforts of
      Sony, Marvel, and the cast to conceal their involvement.
